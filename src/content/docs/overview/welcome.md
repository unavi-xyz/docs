UNAVI is an open source VR social platform, built on the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.

UNAVI aims to bring the success of the web to the third dimension, creating an **interconnected network of 3D worlds**,
instead of 2D pages - all while running on open standards and self-hostable infrastructure.

You can download the UNAVI client natively to your device, or access it from a web browser at [app.unavi.xyz](https://app.unavi.xyz).
UNAVI is available to play on desktop, mobile, or VR.
