The goal of UNAVI is to create a platform that can be built upon by others on every level, from the protocol to the client to the servers.
We are tired of walled gardens and proprietary platforms - we want to create a platform that is **truly open**, a platform that anyone can build upon,
experiment with, and over time a platform that can evolve as the community adopts new features.

## Protocol

[The Wired Protocol](/wired-protocol/about/) is the base layer of UNAVI.
It is an extensible set of standards for how clients and servers should communicate, how worlds should be defined, how user identity is handled, and more.

## Client

The [UNAVI client](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/unavi) is an open source website used to access The Wired.
Anybody can run their own client, and extend it to add new features.

## Server

[Host servers](/wired-protocol/networking/#host) follow an open architecture, allowing anyone to host their worlds on their own servers.
