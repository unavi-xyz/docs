A primary goal of UNAVI is to create a platform that can be built upon by others on every level.

We are tired of walled gardens and proprietary tooling - we want to create a platform that is **truly open**;
a platform that anyone can build upon, experiment with, and over time evolve as the community builds and adopts new features.

## Protocol

[The Wired](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/wired-protocol) is the base layer of UNAVI.
It is a collection of standards focused on self-sovereign identity, interoperability, and freedom for end users.

## Client

The [UNAVI client](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/unavi) is available as both a native build or web client.
Anyone can modify their client, extending it to add new features.

## Server

UNAVI runs on an open network of home servers.
Home servers handle user identity, world hosting, and more.
Anyone can run their own servers - check out the [self-hosting guide](/guides/self-hosting) to learn more.
