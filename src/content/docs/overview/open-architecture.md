UNAVI is a platform that can be built upon by others at every level.

We are tired of walled gardens and proprietary tooling - we want to create a platform that is **truly open**;
a platform that anyone can build upon, experiment with, and over time evolve as the community builds and adopts new features.

### Protocol

[The Wired](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/wired-protocol) is the base layer of UNAVI;
a common protocol that all clients and servers must follow.
It is a collection of standards focused on interactive 3D environments, self-sovereign identity, and interoperability.
UNAVI is an implementation of this protocol.

### Client

The [client](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/unavi) is the main app you use to access The Wired.
Anyone can modify their client, extending it to add new features.

### Server

UNAVI runs on a network of self-hostable servers that handle user identity, world hosting, and more.
Anyone can run their own servers - check out the [self-hosting guide](/guides/self-hosting) to learn more.
