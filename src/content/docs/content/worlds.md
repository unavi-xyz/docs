title: Worlds
---

Worlds are 3D multiplayer environments.
They are the core building block of the platform.

## glTF

World scenes are stored internally as [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) models - an open file format supported by various engines and tools like Blender.
More advanced game functionalities like physics colliders or spawn locations are stored as [glTF extensions](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/README.md).

## Hosting

Just like websites, worlds need servers to host them.

The host server adds **multiplayer functionality** to your world.
It has the job of connecting players together, and facilitating communication between them.

UNAVI runs a host server that is used by default for any worlds created at [unavi.xyz](https://unavi.xyz).
However, you have the option of running your own host server, giving you complete control and ownership of your creations.
Check out the [networking docs](/wired-protocol/networking/#host) for more information on how hosting works.
