The Wired is an open and extensible protocol for creating, hosting, and interacting with 3D virtual worlds.
The protocol is in an early stage of development and may be loosely defined.
Any feedback or contributions are appreciated!

These docs provide an overview of the protocol. The full spec is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/the-wired).
